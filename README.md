## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

Most investment platforms are either locked behind a paywall or overloaded with complexity. I built Stock Sentinel to explore how **AI can assistâ€”rather than replaceâ€”human decision-making** in financial markets. It bridges the gap between accessibility and insight by using:

- Real-time data feeds  
- Sentiment analysis from news/social media  
- Predictive modeling and visualizations

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Managing asynchronous data in React for live updates  
- Parsing financial data from multiple APIs  
- Integrating financial tools (Chart.js, TradingView)  
- Maintaining performance while using free-tier APIs
